How to create ship tileset in Tiled editor
===========================================

1) New map...
- Orientation: orthogonal
- Tile layer format: Base64 (uncompressed)
- Tile render order: Right Down

2) New tileset...
  "Ships", "Exhausts"
  - Type: Based on Tileset image
  - Check "Embed in map" (this is important)

3) Edit tileset "Exhausts"
-> Tile animation editor

4) Delete tile layer (we will only use oject layers)

5) New Object layer "Basic Fighter"
  Insert tile (ship)
  - name: "Ship Hull"
  Insert tile (exhaust)
  - names: "Front Exhaust", "Rear Exhaust", "Front Left Exhaust",
    "Front Right Exhaust", "Rear Left Exhaust", "Rear Right Exhaust"
  // Objects are loaded based on name property and if you name more
  // exhausts "front", all of them will be loaded and threated as front
  // exhausts.
  //   You can keep aspect ratio while scaling by holding down 'Ctrl'.

6) Edit tileset "Ships"
- Tile collision editor
    (edit physics shape)
  - all polygons must be convex

7) File -> Export as -> .json map file

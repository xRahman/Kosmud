/*
  Note:
    ClassFactory creates instances of typescript classes
    using 'Object.create()' rather than 'new'. It means
    that created instances are in fact empty objects with
    no own properties - all of their properties are inherited
    from the prototype object (which is an instance of requested
    class).
      ClassFactory also makes sure that prototypal inheritance
    works correcly event for nonprimitive properties by also
    instantiating them using Object.create() with the respective
    nonprimitive property on the prototype object as their
    prototype. This prevents modifying the prototype object
    when writing to the instance.
